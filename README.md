As a user, so I can remember my bookmarks,
I would like to see a list of bookmarks.

Setting up the database:
1. Connect to psql
2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
